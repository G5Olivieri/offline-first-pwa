# Recommendation System Documentation

## Overview

The POS Recommendation System is a comprehensive, offline-first solution that provides intelligent product suggestions across multiple contexts in the Point of Sale application. It combines collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, market basket analysis, and business rules to deliver personalized recommendations that improve sales and customer experience.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Types & Interfaces** (`src/types/recommendation.ts`)
   - Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for all recommendation entities
   - Includes recommendation types, contexts, and configuration

2. **Recommendation Engine** (`src/services/recommendation-engine.ts`)
   - Core logic for generating recommendations
   - Implements multiple recommendation algorithms
   - Handles data persistence and learning from user interactions

3. **Recommendation Store** (`src/stores/recommendation-store.ts`)
   - Pinia store for managing recommendation state
   - Provides reactive recommendation lists for different contexts
   - Handles caching

4. **Database Integration** (`src/db.ts`)
   - PouchDB databases for offline-first storage
   - Sync capability with remote CouchDB
   - Separate databases for affinities, and preferences

5. **Components** (`src/components/`)
   - Reusable Vue components for displaying recommendations
   - Context-specific recommendation widgets

6. **Composables** (`src/composables/`)
   - Reusable logic for integrating recommendations into any component
   - Specialized composables for different contexts (checkout, homepage, etc.)

## Recommendation Types

### 1. Cross-sell Recommendations
**Type**: `CROSS_SELL`
**Context**: Checkout, Product Detail
**Algorithm**: Products frequently bought with current cart items

### 2. Upsell Recommendations
**Type**: `UPSELL`
**Context**: Checkout, Product Detail
**Algorithm**: Higher-value alternatives in the same category

### 3. Frequently Bought Together
**Type**: `FREQUENTLY_BOUGHT_TOGETHER`
**Context**: Checkout
**Algorithm**: Market basket analysis based on historical order data

### 4. Customer-Based Recommendations

## Data Models

### Product Affinity
Tracks relationships between products based on co-occurrence in orders:

```typescript
type ProductAffinity = {
  product_a_id: string;
  product_b_id: string;
  affinity_score: number; // 0-1 normalized score
  co_occurrence_count: number;
  confidence: number; // P(B|A)
  lift: number; // Confidence / P(B)
}
```

### Customer Product Preference
Tracks individual customer preferences:

```typescript
type CustomerProductPreference = {
  customer_id: string;
  product_id: string;
  preference_score: number; // 0-1 normalized score
  purchase_frequency: number;
  last_purchase_date: string;
  average_quantity: number;
  total_spent: number;
}
```

## Algorithm Details

### Market Basket Analysis
- Uses the Apriori algorithm concept
- Calculates support, confidence, and lift for product pairs
- Updates affinities in real-time as orders are completed
- Minimum support threshold filters out rare combinations

### Collaborative Filtering
- User-based collaborative filtering using customer purchase history
- Similarity calculated using cosine similarity between customer vectors
- Handles cold start problem with content-based fallbacks
- Implicit feedback from purchase behavior

### Content-Based Filtering
- Product similarity based on attributes (category, tags, price range)
- TF-IDF-like scoring for product attributes
- Handles new products effectively
- Category and tag matching with weighted scores

### Trending Algorithm
- Calculates product velocity over configurable time windows
- Weights recent sales more heavily than older sales
- Accounts for seasonal patterns and inventory levels
- Boosts products with increasing sales momentum

## Configuration

### Environment-Based Configuration
```typescript
// Development
{
  enabled: true,
  max_recommendations_per_context: 8,
  min_confidence_threshold: 0.1, // Lower for testing
  cache_duration_minutes: 5,
}

// Production
{
  enabled: true,
  max_recommendations_per_context: 6,
  min_confidence_threshold: 0.4, // Higher for quality
  cache_duration_minutes: 120,
}
```

### Rule-Based Configuration
Rules can be configured to control when and how recommendations are generated:

```typescript
{
  id: 'checkout-frequently-bought-together',
  type: RecommendationType.FREQUENTLY_BOUGHT_TOGETHER,
  context: [RecommendationContext.CHECKOUT],
  priority: 100,
  conditions: [
    { field: 'cart_size', operator: 'greater_than', value: 0 },
    { field: 'product_stock', operator: 'greater_than', value: 0 }
  ],
  parameters: {
    max_recommendations: 4,
    min_affinity_score: 0.4
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage in Components

```vue
<template>
  <RecommendationList
    :recommendations="recommendations"
    :context="RecommendationContext.CHECKOUT"
    title="Frequently Bought Together"
    @add-to-cart="handleAddToCart"
  />
</template>

<script setup>
import { useCheckoutRecommendations } from '@/composables/use-recommendations';

const { recommendations, loadRecommendations } = useCheckoutRecommendations();

async function handleCartUpdate(cartItems) {
  await loadRecommendations({ cartItems });
}
</script>
```

### Advanced Usage with Composables

```typescript
import { useRecommendations } from '@/composables/use-recommendations';
import { RecommendationContext } from '@/types/recommendation';

export function useProductDetailPage(product: Product) {
  const {
    recommendations,
    isLoading,
    trackRecommendationClicked,
    loadRecommendations
  } = useRecommendations({
    context: RecommendationContext.PRODUCT_DETAIL,
    maxRecommendations: 6
  });

  // Load recommendations for current product
  const loadProductRecommendations = () => {
    return loadRecommendations({ currentProduct: product });
  };

  return {
    recommendations,
    isLoading,
    loadProductRecommendations,
    trackRecommendationClicked
  };
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- In-memory caching of recommendations with configurable TTL
- Context-specific cache keys for efficient invalidation
- Automatic cache warming for homepage recommendations

### Database Optimization
- Indexed queries on frequently accessed fields
- Batch operations for updating affinities and preferences

### Real-time Updates
- Immediate updates to customer preferences on purchase
- Incremental updates to product affinities
- Background processing for heavy computations

## Offline-First Considerations

### Data Synchronization
- PouchDB handles offline storage and sync with CouchDB
- Graceful degradation when sync is unavailable
- Conflict resolution for recommendation data

### Fallback Strategies
- Traditional rule-based recommendations when ML data is unavailable
- Category-based suggestions as universal fallback
- Popular products list when no personalized data exists

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Algorithm correctness testing
- Data model validation
- Configuration validation

### Integration Tests
- Database operations
- Sync functionality
- Component integration

### Performance Tests
- Recommendation generation speed
- Memory usage monitoring
- Database query optimization

## Deployment and Scaling

### Database Requirements
- CouchDB cluster for production deployment
- Separate databases for different data types
- Regular backup and maintenance procedures

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Performance metrics collection
- Error rate monitoring
- Recommendation quality metrics

### Feature Flags

- Collaborative filtering
- Content-based filtering
- Market basket analysis
- Seasonal recommendations
- Real-time updates

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Algorithms
- Deep learning models for better personalization
- Multi-armed bandit for A/B testing recommendations
- Graph-based recommendation algorithms

### External Integrations
- Third-party recommendation engines
- External data sources for enhanced recommendations
- API endpoints for recommendation serving

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Customer data anonymization options
- GDPR compliance for recommendation data
- Configurable data retention policies

### Access Control
